	<p class="quote">Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. Just use the old one inch brush.</p>

	<p>Very easy to work these to death. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. This is your world. All those little son of a guns. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend.</p>

	<p>I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Happy painting, God bless. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Take your time. Speed will come later.</p>

	<p class="quote">There comes a nice little fluffer. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important<./p>

	<p>Maybe there's a little something happening right here. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Let's do that again. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting.</p>
