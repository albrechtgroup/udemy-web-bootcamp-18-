<p>Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. Just use the old one inch brush.

<p><span>"I guess I'm a little weird."</span> I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Happy painting, God bless. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Take your time. Speed will come later.
